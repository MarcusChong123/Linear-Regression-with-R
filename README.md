Let’s look at how we can solve a regression problem by using multiple linear regression. We will use a data set with 32 lines of data which describe the total quantity of fruits (Qty) sold in a day at beach or park based on different factors (input variables), including

Orange –> Total quantity of orange prepared on that particular day

Temperature –> Surrounding temperature of that particular day (degree Fahrenheit)

Leaflets –> Number of distributed advertising leaflets

Price –> Price of the fruit (same across all fruits on that particular day)

Location –> Park or Beach
